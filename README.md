Odin-kittens is an app that features a database of kittens. The database allows the user to store information pertaining to each kitten's name, age, cuteness and softness. The main goal of this app is to demonstrate my ability as a coder to make application data accessible via API. This app was built with Ruby on Rails, as part of the full-stack developer curriculum at [theOdinProject](https://theodinproject.com).
